# Lombiq Hosting - Azure Application Insights



## About

This [Orchard Core](https://www.orchardcore.net/) module enables easy integration of [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net/) telemetry into Orchard. Just install the module, configure the instrumentation key from a configuration source (like the *appsettings.json* file) and collected data will start appearing in Application Insights. In a multi-tenant setup you can configure different instrumentation keys to collect request tracking and client-side tracking data on different tenants.
